# Internship-Project-1
This is a 3D shooter game, take inspiration from famous game of VTC game, Phi Doi

What I have learnt throughout this project:

1/ Know the life cycle of a script

2/ How to use UI and make them appear or disappear though code

3/ How to organize between main gameobject such as Player, Enemy and their reference

4/ how to implement coroutine in code

5/ How to make animation to help game more interesting

6/ Know the basic signature of Unity

As this is the demo video of this game, some feature I have to reduce like enemy quantity and quality to help you see more clearly about my game cycle and it's still upgrade many cool feature I have thought

There is shome lag of this video, as I have turned on my laptop for many hours, so it's quite hot at the time a recorded the video

Here is the link of video on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0W_GIZoQzU
